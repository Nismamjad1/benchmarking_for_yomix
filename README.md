# first you have to choose between the options:
1. scanpy (t-test , wilconxon)
2.  cosg
3.  one vs rest or pairwise

# then you will get csv files for each
### you use the csv files to get the heatmaps for mcc scores, time taken by each method
# i am attaching the yomix csv file , you can compare the results by using yomix 
### save the csv and use 
1. time_result.py for time graph 
2. heatmap.py for the heatmaps for different set of features
3. figures.py will show us the mcc scores and the standard deviations
